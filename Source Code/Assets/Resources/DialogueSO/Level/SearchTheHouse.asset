  fullText: ... / There are many notes here, it seems like Dr. Tyndale's workspace
    / Under the moonlight, an ancient and mysterious manuscript is illuminated /
    It's the Voynich Manuscript, a riddle lost to time / Its pages filled with unknown
    symbols and indecipherable text / It appears this scholar uncovered something
    from the manuscript that led him to perform the ritual / The pages clearly outline
    the materials needed for the ceremony / Perhaps I need to revisit the site and
    check the ritual again /
