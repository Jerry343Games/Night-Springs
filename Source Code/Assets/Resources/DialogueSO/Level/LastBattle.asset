  fullText: "I fought Tyndale here, but he refused to let go of the crystal in his
    hand / The altar was nearing completion / A deep fissure appeared upon it, unleashing
    a nameless terror from within / Tyndale collapsed to the ground / I struggled
    to resist the chaos pouring out of the rift and forced myself to look inside
    / It seemed to be a figure in a suit\u2014a shadow slowly summoned from the fissure,
    surrounded by an unrecognizable black mist / He picked up the crystal\u2014the
    one pulsing with dark power\u2014from the ground / In an instant, I lost consciousness...
    /... /... / When I opened my eyes, I was back in the familiar Writer's House
    / I had returned to the beginning... / But... / In my hand, I held the dark,
    glowing crystal /"
