  fullText: I returned to the subway... / At first, it was just the unsettling feeling
    in the air / Then the darkness grew thicker before my eyes, and all the lights
    went out / The members of the Cult of the Word must have done something here,
    creating this suffocating darkness / I struggled to find the breaker, restoring
    power and turning the lights back on / After barely pushing back the darkness,
    I made my way toward the ruins / There, I found a sphere shrouded in a dense,
    impenetrable shadow / I realized this was part of his final ritual, gathering
    enough darkness to offer as a sacrifice to that mysterious force /
